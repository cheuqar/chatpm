# Recommended Hardware Specifications for Developer PC

To effectively develop and run the **chatpm** application, it's important to have a developer PC that meets certain hardware requirements. These recommendations ensure smooth development, testing, and execution of all components, including the local Language Model (LLM), Docker containers, and development tools.

## Minimum Specifications

- **Processor (CPU):**
  - Quad-Core CPU (e.g., Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5)

- **Memory (RAM):**
  - 16 GB RAM

- **Storage:**
  - 256 GB SSD (Solid State Drive)

- **Graphics Card (GPU):**
  - Integrated Graphics

- **Operating System:**
  - Windows 11 (64-bit)

## Recommended Specifications

- **Processor (CPU):**
  - Eight-Core CPU or higher (e.g., Intel Core i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 7/9)

- **Memory (RAM):**
  - 32 GB RAM or more

- **Storage:**
  - 512 GB SSD or larger
  - Additional HDD for data storage (optional)

- **Graphics Card (GPU):**
  - Dedicated GPU with at least 4 GB VRAM (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 or higher)
    - **Note:** While a GPU is not strictly necessary for this project, it can accelerate certain tasks and be beneficial for future development involving machine learning.

- **Operating System:**
  - Windows 11 Pro (64-bit)

## Justification for Recommended Specifications

- **Processor (CPU):**
  - Running Docker containers, especially multiple ones (backend, frontend, database), requires a strong CPU.
  - Local LLMs like **Llama 3.1:8b** can be CPU-intensive during inference.

- **Memory (RAM):**
  - **LLM Requirements:**
    - LLMs can consume significant RAM. Running **Llama 3.1:8b** may require 16 GB or more.
  - **Development Tools:**
    - Running an IDE like **VSCode**, browsers for testing, and other development tools simultaneously benefits from additional RAM.

- **Storage:**
  - **SSD for Performance:**
    - An SSD improves system responsiveness and reduces load times for applications and files.
  - **Disk Space:**
    - Docker images, especially for databases and LLMs, can consume significant disk space.

- **Graphics Card (GPU):**
  - While not essential for initial development, a dedicated GPU can:
    - Accelerate machine learning tasks if you decide to train models locally.
    - Improve performance in applications that leverage GPU processing.

- **Operating System:**
  - **Windows 11 Pro:**
    - Provides features like Hyper-V, useful for virtualization and containerization tasks.

## Additional Recommendations

- **Internet Connection:**
  - Stable and fast internet for downloading dependencies, Docker images, and accessing documentation and resources.

- **Peripherals:**
  - Dual monitors for increased productivity.
  - Quality keyboard and mouse for comfortable coding sessions.

- **Backup Solution:**
  - External hard drive or cloud backup service to regularly back up your development work.

- **Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS):**
  - To prevent data loss during power outages.

## Software Requirements

- **Development Tools:**
  - **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** with necessary extensions.
  - **Docker Desktop** for container management.
  - **Node.js** and **npm** for frontend development.
  - **Python 3.x** for backend development.
  - **Ollama** for running the local LLM.

- **Database Tools:**
  - **pgAdmin** or **DBeaver** for interacting with PostgreSQL.

## Future-Proofing

Investing in higher specifications can provide:

- **Longevity:**
  - A system that remains capable for a longer period without needing upgrades.

- **Scalability:**
  - Ability to handle more demanding tasks in the future, such as:
    - Running larger LLMs.
    - Supporting additional services or containers.
    - Development in resource-intensive areas.
